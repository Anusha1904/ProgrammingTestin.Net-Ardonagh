**1.Choice of frontend technoloy**
In this solution, I have choosen Bootstrap, CSS, HTML as frontend technologies to implement. As there is no need to store data persistently,
I have not used any other .Net stack.
**2. Design decisions taken**
Used bootstrap form templates to add and edit customer details and added necessary validations.
**3. Any issues found**
I didn't find any issues.
**4. What would be your next steps to further improve your work?**
Further, we can imporove the application by adding database to store the data persistently and can enhance background styles(for same functionality)
